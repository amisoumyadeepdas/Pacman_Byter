This project is a simplified remake of the classic Pacman game.

# Game Objective
The goal of the game is to navigate Pacman through a maze, collect all the points scattered throughout the maze, and avoid the ghosts. Pacman's position and body are animated, with his mouth opening and closing to create the illusion of movement.

Pacman Animation: Pacman's movement is animated with four different images representing his body, depending on the direction he moves.
Point Collection: Pacman collects points as he moves through the maze.
Ghost Avoidance: You must navigate Pacman to avoid colliding with the ghosts, which will result in losing a life.
Lives and Score: Pacman starts with three lives, and your score increases as points are collected.
